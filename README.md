This project aims to create an application that identifies food items from images and provides an estimate of their calorie content. Using advanced image processing and deep learning techniques, the system can classify different foods and calculate their caloric values. This tool offers a convenient way for users to monitor their calorie intake by simply taking a picture of their meal, making healthy eating habits easier to manage and maintain.
